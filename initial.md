## What is this? Why?
AWS is pretty awsome in that you can do a lot with near-zero equipment investment.  But you do still ened a computer of some kind to do anything with it.  HOw much of a computer? NOt much. THe goal of this writeup is to walk you through connecting to the major AWS services on an equipment budget of $250.

## The Gear
As of this writing (2019-01-19), here's my recommended hardware.  OThers will undoubtedly work; this is just what I've tested personally.

- Samsung Chromebook 3 - ~$180 [link tbd]
  - dualcore
  - 4 gb ram
  - 1376 x 768 rez
  - ~6 hour battery
- Yubikey U2F Security Key (x2)  - ~$40 [link tbd]
  - sufficient for AWS IAM U2F 2FA
  
## Account Prep
  I'm gonna leave this as an excercise for the user, or another gist.
  Set up an AWS Acct. Follow the prompts to secure it. Create an IAM Admin to use and put the root creds away somewhere safe.
  Set up U2F 2FA on your IAM admin account.
